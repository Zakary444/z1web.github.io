            <p>Well, not right now exactly, but definitely very soon. To be perfectly honest, it makes me nervous even though I'm confident I'll do even better this year than the last. Its what lies ahead of school, even if it is just more school, that I'm
                afraid of. I'm applying for junior (insert programming title here) jobs all over because I feel like the experience in any given language/facet of the industry would be very beneficial to have. The thought of doing serious work in the
                field of programming is very exciting, but from entry-level, may require relocation, which is scary. I suppose some things balance out naturally like that, and taking up residence in a big city shouldn't be too much of an issue, but change
                is change.
                <br> I've got really not much else to add here, other than I hope it all goes well and everything I do is worth doing. Thank you for reading, even if it is just me in the future. In that case; Hellooo

            <h2>Made the website.</h2>
            <p>Finally made the website. What to put on it? I guess skills... accomplishments... hopes and dreams? ...Not exactly sure yet. When more is going on maybe I can use it as a resume or portfolio type-beat. Until then, I'll probably focus on making
                irl $ and improving this little site. I'll do occassional updates here, really for no other reason than to personally track progress. <br> aaand that's about all I got.</p>
